    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I’m a motivated beginner software engineering student with a strong interest in building interactive and useful websites. Before diving into coding, I spent several years working with electronic supplies — especially computers and accessories — which helped me develop a technical mindset and attention to detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have hands-on experience in event planning and photography. These roles taught me how to be organized, creative, and work well with different types of people — skills that I now apply to designing and developing websites. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has opened up a whole new world for me, and this portfolio is my way of sharing that journey. I’m excited to keep learning, keep creating, and one day build things that help others.
